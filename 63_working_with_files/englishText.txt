There are four people in my family. The mother is me and then of course my husband belongs to it. We have two children, a six-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter.

We live in a small house with a garden. There the children can play a bit. Our son is coming to school soon, our daughter is going to kindergarten for a while. My children are at home in the afternoon. So I only work half-time.
